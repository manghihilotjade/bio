				<b>I am Jade Manghihilot and i am  Computer Engineering Student of CITE school.
				My goals in life are to study hard, be my dream job and give my family a better life.
				I also have a inspirational qoute and I would like to share it "Trust yourself that you can do it"
				this quote is by Baz Luhrmann. I always relay my life to this qoute, this means even how hard life is I would still
				fight, even if a lot of works to do I will accomplish it and even there is the time you wanted to give up just talk to go, "you can do it"
				I am also inspired by my Mother.</b>
